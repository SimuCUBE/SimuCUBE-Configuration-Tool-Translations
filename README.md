## FAQ

Q: Do I need to keep the translation updated?

A: It would be nice, but not mandatory. Eventually, if enough changes are made, non-up-to-date translation will be dropped from the SimuCUBE Configuration Tool distribution.

Q: A language is missing, can I still translate to that language?

A: Yes. For missing languages, please write it as an issue or let us know otherwise, and we will add the appropriate template file for that language.

Q: Whats up with the %1 %2 etc. markers in the text?

A: Usually, the are used to make the text **bold** with a html tag, stop making text bold with html tag, or to add other html tags at those positions, for example, to generate the surrounded text as a link to a WWW site. Also, in some cases, a lonely %1 will get replaced by a numeric value. 



Q: I have other questions?

A: Yes, please ask them in an issue on this repository or in our Community Forum at
